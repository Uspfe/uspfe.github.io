This site is templated and extended from <a href="https://keunhong.com/">Keunhong Park's</a> website. It is build with [jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) and [bulma](https://bulma.io/), and can be hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Feel free to re-use this page. It would be great if you link back to my [homepage](oliver.hausdoerfer.de)!

### Adapt the website for your needs
- change the personal information in `_config.yml`.
- Make sure your `images` have an aspect ratio of 1:1 and are least 320px.
- if you wish to use the submission form for emails, create your own Google AppScript for a GoogleSheet and replace the `googleAppScriptUrl` in `index.js` with your url. You can ask ChatGPT how to create a App Script.
- if you wish to use google analytics, you need to enable the tracker in `index.html`.
